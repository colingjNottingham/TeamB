If you look at the customer \"Jaswinder Singh\" then you will see that there are two similar entries - same name, similar address, same email, but different numbers of orders. What do you think should be done with this entry? I would suggest that it make sense to combine the two rows into one, and add the total number of orders together - this looks like the same customer has created two accounts. Do you agree? This demonstrates that deciding what to do about duplicate and near-duplicate entries isn't trivial - you need to think about the context of the data. If you are confident with coding, write some code in the next block to do this - this is rather challenging, though, so you might want to move on to the next task."

So, write some code in the next block that loops through the rows, and if the \"Order Type\" is Packets, multiplies the \"Order Total\" column by 12. For consistency, you should then change the \"Order Type\" to Individual, though you could perhaps neglect this because we are going to delete the \"Order Type\" column soon because it is not needed in the final format."
